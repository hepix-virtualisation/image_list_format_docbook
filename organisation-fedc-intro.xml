    <para>The &fedc; has the following objective.</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>Test tools for clouds.</listitem>
    <listitem>Bring tools to production.</listitem>
    <listitem>Experiment with large scale cloud deployments.</listitem>

    <title>Scope</title>
    <para>The &fedc; main focus is to provide sites a way to control and mange cloud enviroments for scientific computing.</para>
    <para>With such a diversity of cloud solutions all under going very active development it is 
    impossible for a group such as &fedc; to only support a single cloud implementation, as we would not be 
    serving the needs of the &hepix; site community.</para>
    <para>One of the side effects of &egi; having pioneered Grid computing, is that the community have already 
    learned about the diversity of sites, and considerable effort has been put into minimising the differences 
    between sites from a experiments perspective. The &hep; community and sites serving them have come to understand 
    that some areas of site management are not practical to unify. In areas where tools and practices are 
    developing quickly innovation is potentially hindered by enforcing standardisation. This is also true that 
    site management requires considerable effort which has already been invested, and change would be detrimental, 
    a good example of this is in site deployment and configuration. The &fedc; decided very early on that we 
    where not going to look into areas that would effect sites local deployment and configuration. The rational 
    was that many sites already had virtualisation strategies, and sites that did not, should not be prevented 
    from working with newer tools and cloud infrastructures.</para>

  <section id="organisation-fedc-intro-usecases">
    <title>Usecases</title>
    <para>Due to the scope defined for the &fedc; the following use cases have been highlighted for investigation 
    from the perspective of the site.</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>Auditability of &vee; to and equivalent or higher degree than they could a batch queue job.</listitem>
      <listitem>The ability for sites to store old &vee; for forensic purposes.</listitem>
      <listitem>Knowledge of which people and which groups are allowed to run &vee; in their trusted parts of their network.</listitem>
    </itemizedlist> 
    <para>Due to the scope defined for the &fedc; the following use cases have been highlighted for investigation 
    from the perspective of the experiment.</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>Experiments having the benefits of running the same &vee; at many sites.</listitem>
      <listitem>Experiments having the ability to update &vee; without having to contact each site.</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>
  <section id="organisation-fedc-intro-vwg-scope">
    <title>&fedc; Scope</title>  
    <para>From these basic use cases the &fedc; decided to focuses on four main areas of investigation.</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>A security policy for managing &vee;.</listitem>
      <listitem>A recipe to make site neutral &vee;.</listitem>
      <listitem>A mechanism to distribute &vee; consistent with the requirements and use cases of &hepix; sites.</listitem>
      <listitem>A mechanism to make site neutral &vee; interact with the site batch queue.</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>These four areas of investigation have led to the sections which make up the remainder of this document.</para>
